# STAPDP Simulations


This repository contains the R Package files required to run the STAP-DP Simulations described in the "Heterogeneous Effects in the Built Environment" manuscript authored by Peterson, Sanchez-Vaznaugh and Sanchez.

The relevant simulation functions are in the R repository and use functions from the rstapDP R package. A demonstration of how the simulation results can be obtained is 
available in the Final.Rmd vignette file in the vignettes folder.
